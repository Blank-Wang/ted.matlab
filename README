Neural Population Encoding Using Filters with Arbitrary Delays
==============================================================

This Matlab software demonstrates how to decode a signal encoded by a
population of integrate-and-fire neurons with receptive fields that
delay the encoded signal by arbitrary known lengths of time.

The implementation in this package was written by Eftychios A. Pnevmatikakis,
currently at the Bionet Group [1] at Columbia University. The code was
reviewed and packaged by Lev Givon, also of the Bionet Group.
