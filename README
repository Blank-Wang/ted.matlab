Time Encoding and Decoding Toolbox
==================================

Package Description
-------------------

The Time Encoding and Decoding Toolbox contains Matlab implementations
of algorithms designed to reversibly convert digitally sampled signals
to and from a time-domain representation consisting of a series of
time intervals between fixed-amplitude spikes. Sample code and
documentation demonstrating the use of the implementations is
included.

Future releases of this package may be obtained from the Bionet
Group's online code repository [1]_.

Authors & Acknowledgments
-------------------------

The implementations in this toolbox were written by the following
members of the Bionet Group at Columbia University's Department of
Electrical Engineering under the supervision of Prof. Aurel A. Lazar
[2]_:

* Lev Givon
* Eftychios A. Pnevmatikakis
* Robert J. Turetsky

Some portions of the code are based (in part) on previous implementations
written by the following Bionet Group members:

* Robert J. Turetsky
* Yevgeniy Slutskiy

Special thanks are due to the following Bionet Group members for 
reviewing parts of the code and providing useful suggestions:

* Robert J. Turetsky
* Yiyin Zhou

The software in this toolbox was integrated and packaged by Lev Givon.
