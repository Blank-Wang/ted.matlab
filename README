Time Encoding and Decoding Toolbox
==================================

Package Description
-------------------

The Time Encoding and Decoding Toolbox contains Matlab implementations
of algorithms designed to reversibly convert digitally sampled signals
to and from a time-domain representation consisting of a series of
time intervals between fixed-amplitude spikes. Sample code and
documentation demonstrating the use of the implementations is
included.

Authors & Acknowledgments
-------------------------

The implementations in this package were written by Lev Givon [1]_,
currently at the Bionet Group at Columbia University. Some parts of
the code are based (in part) on previous implementations written by
the following members of the Bionet Group:

* Eftychios Pnevmatikakis
* Yevgeniy Slutskiy
* Robert Turetsky

Special thanks are due to the following Bionet Group members for 
reviewing the code and providing useful suggestions:

* Robert Turetsky
* Yiyin Zhou

All of the time encoding and decoding algorithms currently comprised
by the toolbox were developed by Aurel Lazar [2]_, currently at
Columbia University's Electrical Engineering Department.
