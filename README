Time Encoding and Decoding Toolbox
==================================

The Time Encoding and Decoding Toolbox contains Matlab implementations
of algorithms designed to reversibly convert finite-length,
band-limited, digitally sampled signals to and from a time-domain
representation consisting of a series of time intervals between
fixed-amplitude spikes. Sample code demonstrating the use of the
implementations is included.

Authors & Acknowledgements
==========================

The implementations in this package were written by Lev Givon,
currently at the Bionet Group [1] at Columbia University. Some parts
of the code are based (in part) on previous implementations written by
the following members of the Bionet Group:

Eftychios Pnevmatikakis
Yevgeniy Slutskiy
Robert Turetsky

Special thanks are due to the following Bionet Group members for 
reviewing the code and providing useful suggestions:

Robert Turetsky
Yiyin Zhou

All of the time encoding and decoding algorithms currently comprised
by the toolbox were developed by Aurel Lazar [2], currently at
Columbia University's Electrical Engineering Department.
