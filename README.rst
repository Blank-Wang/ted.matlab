Time Encoding and Decoding Toolbox
==================================

Package Description
-------------------

The Time Encoding and Decoding Toolbox contains MATLAB implementations
of algorithms designed to reversibly convert digitally sampled signals
to and from a time-domain representation consisting of a series of
time intervals between fixed-amplitude spikes. Sample code and
documentation demonstrating the use of the implementations is
included.

Future releases of this package may be obtained from the Bionet
Group's online code repository [1]_.
