Installation Instructions
=========================

1. The Time Encoding and Decoding Toolbox requires that the Bionet
   Matlab Utilities (available at http://bionet.ee.columbia.edu/code)
   be installed in order to run.

2. Unpack the archive into an installation directory. Assuming that
   Matlab is installed in the directory $MATLAB, one may wish to
   install the software in $MATLAB/toolbox/ted if one has
   administrative access to the machine.

3. Add the subdirectories of the installation directory to Matlab's
   search path so that the functions comprised by the toolbox may be
   easily accessed. For example, if the software is installed in
   $MATLAB/toolbox/ted, one may add the following lines to the list of
   paths in $MATLAB/toolbox/local/pathdef.m and restart Matlab to make 
   the toolbox contents available:

   matlabroot,'/toolbox/ted/ted:', ...
   matlabroot,'/toolbox/ted/teddemos:', ...
