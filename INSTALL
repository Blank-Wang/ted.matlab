Installation Instructions
=========================

1. Unpack the archive into an installation directory. Assuming that
   Matlab is installed in the directory $MATLAB, one may wish to
   install the software in $MATLAB/toolbox/tdc if one has
   administrative access to the machine.

2. Add the subdirectories of the installation directory to Matlab's
   search path. For example, if the software is installed in
   $MATLAB/toolbox/utils, one may add the following lines to the list of
   paths in $MATLAB/toolbox/local/pathdef.m and restart Matlab to make the 
   toolbox contents available:

   matlabroot,'/toolbox/utils:', ...
   matlabroot,'/toolbox/utils/utils:', ...
   matlabroot,'/toolbox/utils/demos:', ...
